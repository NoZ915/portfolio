      '"Item Selection for Parallel Test Construction" is a project I completed for the AI course in the second semester of 2024. The frontend was built using React JS, React Query, and the MUI framework. The backend was developed with Node JS and Express JS, and MongoDB was used as the NoSQL database. Both frontend and backend were deployed on the Zeabur platform.',
    intro2:
      "In addition, to apply theories of Genetic Algorithms and Parallel Test Construction in practice, I studied relevant research papers and implemented the concepts in the backend API, enabling users to perform item selection through the frontend interface.",

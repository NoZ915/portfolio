      '"binGoä½µ" is a group project I completed during the final of the "Database Systems" course in the second semester of 2023. The frontend was built with EJS, CSS, and JavaScript, while the backend was developed using Node.js and the Express.js framework. MongoDB, a NoSQL database, was used for data storage. Both frontend and backend were deployed on the Zeabur platform (currently taken offline).',

      "This was my first experience working as a backend developer collaborating with frontend teammates. From brainstorming and discussing the system architecture to ensuring feature completeness, the project aimed to provide users with a platform to easily find others to share free shipping, combine orders, or make group purchases.",

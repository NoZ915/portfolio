      'This maze game was developed using the DIVE platform provided by our university lab during the "Computational Thinking" course in the first semester of 2019. JavaScript was used to connect different scenes, enabling smooth transitions between levels. Players control the main character, Jimmy Dog, to dodge or attack monsters and reach the end point to complete each level.',
    intro2:
      "The gameplay combines health points, attack conditions (players must drink a potion before attacking), and monsters with unique movement patterns, adding both challenge and fun. If the characterâ€™s health drops to zero, the game restarts, increasing its replayability.",
    features: [
      "Control Jimmy Dog to move and attack",
      "Five uniquely designed mini-map levels",
      "Monsters have different movement patterns; players must dodge or defeat them",
      "Attack is only possible after drinking a potion (C key to drink, X key to attack)",
      "Taking damage from monsters reduces health; the game restarts if health reaches zero",

      '"Dengue Fever Learning Management System" is a final project I completed for the "Learning Management Systems" course in the second semester of 2022. The frontend was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it integrates with the schoolâ€™s DIVE platform API to implement interactive game features. The backend was developed using PHP, with a MySQL database. Both frontend and backend were hosted using phpMyAdmin, and ngrok was used to make the site accessible externally.',
